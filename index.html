                <br> <br>
                Serf Club is an infinite film constructed from global live streams. A drama playing out in real life and in real time. The algorithmic director, influenced by intuitive, geographical, relational factors, modulates an audio-visual signal to make meaning appear and disappear. Shot reverse shot. Close-up on tangled plotlines. Build suspense and tear it down. Cut to cables snaking across borders. Cue music. Algorithmic real time film .
                  <br> <br>
                For the project Serf Club, Visser and design collective PWR re-evaluated mapping<span class="dots">...</span>
                <span class="text-extra">
                  in the age of internet 2.0. This development coincided with the bombings and attacks of ISIS on Brussels, Munich and Istanbul, in which the livestream was a recurring medium of immediate information. They became interested in the livestream as an immediate map, as well as its aesthetics. This led to the creation of the continuous live film Serf Club, an algorithm gathering and displaying content in real time. Serf Club connects to 2500 livestreams distributed evenly over the world, and simultaneously generates narrative and sound. It is a tool continuously balancing between randomness and meaning.

            Complexity is always at the core of Jasmijn Visser’s practice, especially in relation to geopolitical conflict. In an age of internet 2.0., the perception of our world, as well as experience of time has shifted. In order to interpret this shift, Visser explores ordering, aesthetics and narrative patterns of geopolitical cases, and proposes new forms of complexity framing.
            <br> <br>
            Rather then reducing, abstracting or simplifying complexity, the artist seeks a way explain complexity through complexity, for example in Conflict Atlas, where she shifts the centre of the earth to the Falkland Islands to view global conflict from their perspective, or in We, the Presidents of Planet Earth , where she stages a conversation between the Kalmyk and Velimir Khlebnikov: by use of their own time-space-constructions they speak about collective trauma, or in Hörspiel, an artwork on crowd psychology which expands and turns into an time-based-exhibition, incorporating works by other artists, which appear and disappear through the space.
            <br> <br>
            Just as Visser questions the structures which build the foundation of our society, she also turns more introspective and questions what an artist is, and what the artwork can be. The artist concedes autonomy by working in multiple collaborative constructions, wether interdisciplinary or trans-disciplinary. Her artworks often are accessible online or even made by using existing structures of the internet. In her upcoming project occur Visser will investigate and expand on this method through a large collaborative research project on complexity modelling in relation to climate change.

            Jasmijn Visser was a resident at De Ateliers Amsterdam. Before that she studied Fine Arts, as well as Design & Education at the Utrecht School of the Arts. She is a recent fellow at Delfina Foundation London. In 2020 Visser will be a fellow at Meertens Institute Amsterdam, where she will research Climate Change, Complexity & Language.
            <br> <br>
            Visser’s projects often consist long term on-site research, such as on the Falkland Islands, Siberia, Kalmykia, South Korea. For this research, she collaborates with universities such as the University of Amsterdam, Cambridge, Duisburg-Essen, Cologne and the Freie Universität Berlin. Experimental design is a key element of Visser’s practice, for which she has collaborated with Metahaven, PWR, Stefan Schäfer and Trang Ha.
